# PS3 SixAxis DualShock BT Controller
This amazing electronic device is cheap and precise enough to be used as a primary 
input device for driving the robot when paired with a human.
I have decided to enable builtin bluetooth capabilities in order to support direct
connection with it, this directory contains utilities and documentation for a full
PS3 controller BT support.
